All containers are numbered clockwise from 1 to n. The robot sorter itself is located in the center. There are mconditional items in its loading module. The sorter begins pouring items into containers, starting with container number 1, moving clockwise. A container with number i receives i items. If the robot cannot empty the required number of items into the current container, then the remaining items remain in the loading module and the process ends. And then the designers had a problem - how to find out how many items are left in the loading module without a special mechanical procedure for recalculating them? Well, for example, to load the next batch of items taking into account their balance. Or initially load the required number of items. In short, they need to know this and that’s it. Help the guys!

To control the inclusion of a particular LED, we number the matrix as follows: rows x from top to bottom from 1 to m, columns y from left to right from 1 to n. Then any LED in the matrix will have a coordinate (x, y). In this case, the LED with coordinate (1,1) is the upper left edge of the matrix, with coordinate (m,n) - the lower right edge of the matrix. By lighting the LEDs, you can obtain different light and color images on the matrix. For now, let's learn how to “draw” (light up) rectangles, which we will define by the coordinates of two LEDs in opposite corners (upper left, lower right) - points with coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). To distinguish between different rectangles, in our task we will depict them with symbols of the English alphabet (the first rectangle is represented by the letters “a”, the second by “b”, the third by “c”, etc.) - like they are of different colors. An LED that was not used when “drawing”, that is, it does not light, will be denoted by the symbol “.” (dot).

Pitosha needs to pour all the test tubes into one container. But you need to be careful - it's chemistry. If you pour out substances at random, an unexpected and violent reaction may occur, ending in an explosion. Therefore, we will do it as follows: we will take any two test tubes and combine their contents (merge them into one larger test tube). Then we will repeat this process until there is only one container left with the contents of all the test tubes. This is what needed to be done. The contents of each test tube are known and written down. They contain a solution of a wide variety of substances with very different percentages. But in each test tube there is a substance with the maximum percentage - this is the most active substance in the test tube and the most dangerous. Pitosha knows for sure that it is forbidden to combine the contents of those test tubes in which the percentage of the active substance does not match. To prevent an explosion from happening, the active substances in the test tubes must have the same percentage. This point is extremely important! To drain such test tubes, you need to change the percentage of the active substance. This can only be done by evaporating water, which leads to an increase in the percentage of the active substance and, accordingly, all other substances in the test tube by the same amount. In addition, there is a certain “critical mass of experience” - that is, it is impossible to increase the percentage of substances indefinitely, there is there is a critical limit to this, and it is numerically equal to the minimum total value by which it is necessary to increase the percentage of all substances in the process of combining them into one container.

A famous palindrome is the phrase from the fairy tale about Pinocchio: “and the rose fell on the Azor’s paw.” Let's assume that the empty string is also a palindrome. Harry introduced a new concept of a string - a garridrome. A string is a garridrome if it is possible to find such a character in it, and then remove this character from the string in a completely random order so that the remaining string (after gluing the remaining parts together) becomes a palindrome. For example: • “pop” is a garridrome because it is possible not remove any character and the term will become a palindrome (that is, a palindrome is automatically a garridrome).• \"upope\" is a garridrome because one can take a character \"y\" and remove both \"y\" characters from the string. The remaining string becomes a palindrome.• \"upoupu\" is a garridrome because you can take the character \"y\" and remove either all the \"y\" characters in the string or just the fourth \"y\" character. In both cases, the remaining strings will become palindromes.• \"pot\" is not a harridrome because there is no character that, when removed, will make the string a palindrome.You are given a string.

For example, the number of visible points on the tower drawn below is 29 - the number of points on the top edge of the top cube is 1. And on the four sides of the tower, faces with the following number of points are visible: 5 and 3 on the south side, 4 and 2 on the west side, 2 and 4 on the north side, and 3 and 5 on the east side. The bottom edge of the first cube (with one) and the faces with six points are not visible, so they are not taken into account in the number visible points.T robots were invited to the event, each of which has a favorite numberxi. Then I was assigned to write a program to determine for each of the numbersxi whether it is possible to build a tower of cubes for which the number of visible points is equal to this number. In those days, I coped with this task, and the event was successful. Will it be possible for you today?\n\nInput format:\nThe first line contains one integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000)—the number of invited robots. The second line contains Tintegersxi (1 ≤ xi ≤ 1018)—the favorite numbers of robots.\n\nOutput format:\nFor each favorite number, print \"YES\" if a tower can be built, or \"NO\" otherwise (without quotes).\n\nExamples\n\\nInput:\\n4\\n29 34 19 38\\nOutput:\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO\\n\n\nNote:\nThe first example is analyzed in the condition.

In the third example, a single cube placed in such a way that 5 points are depicted on the top face is sufficient. In the fourth example, there is no tower with the required number of visible points .",

Initially, the height of the sand relative to a certain conventional mark in all sections was equal to zero. After this, n strong gusts of wind occurred, which changed the landscape of the dune. Wind gust number i had strength xi and affected areas from li to ri. As a result of this gust, the height of section number li increased by xi, the height of section number li + 1 decreased by xi, the next one increased again by xi, and so on up to section number ri, inclusive.

However, it is not known how many light bulbs of each color are needed, and the city budget is too small to buy light bulbs with a reserve. It is guaranteed that for each of the four colors at least one light bulb remains working. It is known that the garland consists of light bulbs of four colors: red, blue, yellow and green. The garland is made as follows: if you take any four consecutive light bulbs, then among them there are no light bulbs of the same color. For example, a garland can be \"RYBGRYBGRY\", \"YBGRYBGRYBG\", \"BGRYB\", but cannot be \"BGRYG\", \"YBGRYBYGR\" or \"BGYBGY\". The letters represent the colors: 'R' - red, 'B' - blue, 'Y' - yellow, 'G' - green.

Как прознает, что в другом царстве есть какой-то обычай, сразу думает, как бы его к тридевятым реалиям приспособить.Вот неделю назад вернулось посольство из Тридесятого царства. И главный посол доложил царю: дескать, придумал Тридесятый царь следующую вещь. Чтобы как-то зарегулировать гуляния народные, повелел он указать определенные дни, и в эти дни устраивать широкие гуляния, а в остальные дни массовые сборища запретить. И с тех пор жизнь в Тридесятом царстве стала прекрасной: гулять так гулять, работать так работать, и все строго по цареву указу.Понравилась мысль такая царю Тридевятого царства. Подумал он ввести и у себя такие порядки. Собрал царь советников своих, и говорит: подготовьте мне список дней, в которые гулять можно. Только не на год, а на N дней вперед — посмотрим, дескать, что получится; понравится — сделаем круглогодичным.И вот вчера принесли советники царю список. Но вот незадача: каждый совет­ник свой список приготовил, да еще и обоснование предложил, какой праздник в какой из этих дней надо отмечать. И у всех советников праздники важные, но у всех — разные! Царь думал-думал и решил: а возьмем их все — объединим пред­ложения советников! Если какой-то день есть в списке хотя бы одного советника, то объявим этот день праздничным, и пускай народ гуляет! Глядишь, и не будет недовольных.Только одна проблема осталась: некоторые дни оказались в списках сразу у нескольких советников. Но царь и тут нашел выход: перенесем некоторые праздни­ки на более поздние дни, так, чтобы в каждый день получался только один празд­ник, и переносы были бы как можно короче.Пусть, например, четыре советника сразу предложили сделать некоторый день (пускай день 5) праздничным.

Everything would be fine if there weren’t a coffee machine on the floor below: schoolchildren drinking coffee pose a particular danger to newly painted walls, since sometimes they spill coffee and it splashes the walls located from the student at a distance less than some given R (if the distance to the wall is equal to R, it does not get dirty). To combat this scourge, in one of the secret laboratories of the Institute of Applied Physics RAS, a system is being developed that, at the moment a schoolchild spills coffee, registers its coordinates (x, y) and the radius of the coffee’s spread R. It is assumed that it will be installed in all freshly painted rooms, and observational data will be be recorded in a single journal. Each room is considered a rectangle of non-zero area with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Your task in this project is to develop a code that will determine which coffee spills recorded in the log resulted in staining the walls.\n\nInput format:\nThe input file contains the contents of the coffee pour log. The first line indicates the number of entries in the log N (1 ≤ N ≤ 20). The second and subsequent lines contain the records themselves, one record per line. Each entry represents 7 numbers x1, y1, x2, y2, R, x, y, separated by spaces. Here (x1,y1), (x2,y2) are the coordinates of two opposite corners of the room in which this coffee spill was recorded, R is the radius of the coffee scattering, (x, y) are the coordinates of the point inside the room in which the coffee was spilled. All coordinates in the input file are integer and do not exceed 10,000 in absolute value, the radius R is also integer, 0 ≤ R ≤ 10,000.\n\nOutput format:\nThe output file should contain N lines.

And we decided to play the famous game “Stream”. Oh, this is so much fun. Let's remember the rules of fun. All participants are divided into pairs of a boy and a girl, stand in a column one after another with their hands raised. Boys on one side, girls on the other. The game begins like this: the couple located at the end of the “stream” breaks up and runs inside the column, choosing a new partner along the way (the boy is a new girl, and the girl is a new boy), new couples stand at the beginning of the stream. Those who have lost their pair run to the end of the column, run inside and choose a new partner, and so on. Due to the new couples appearing in front, the column seems to “run” forward like a stream accompanied by general laughter and joy, very cheerfully and cheerfully. After the tournament, stay and play. In the meantime, before the game starts, we want to divide the children into pairs so that the total difference in height across all pairs is minimal. Write a program that will determine what minimum total difference can be obtained.\n\nInput format:\nThe first line contains one number n – the number of pairs (1 n ≤ 1000).

Alyosha, Borya, Semyon, Dima, Egor, Fedor and Grisha came to study with her. And she immediately decided to submit the recorded song to the inter-district online competition. I ordered a recording studio and DJ Spock (before this task he was a very calm guy). However, it turned out that not everything was so simple. The little children didn't want to sing together. Together they didn’t hit the notes at all, but they hit the Accordion Note very well when they spat. And they couldn’t remember all the words of the song, so they had to break it down literally into words. Each unfortunate singer received his own words, and one could begin to create a song, recording each one separately, but then another problem became clear. One by one they also refused to sing. You see, they are scared to stand at the microphone, because it looks like a snake. They agreed that they would sign up in pairs. As a result, in order to get the final song, Note Akkordovna and Spock will then need to mix the recorded tracks together. In this case, naturally, the last singer in the first recorded track must coincide with the first singer in the second track, and so on. For example, if Spock recorded a track with Alyosha and Borya \"AB\", and then with Borya and Alyosha \"BA\", he can mix them together and get a piece of the song “ABA”, and then combine the result with the string “AB” and get the song “ABAB”. In general, something like this, everything seems simple, but Spock has already changed his nickname to a new one - now he is DJ Psycho. Save the guy and Nota Akkordovna, help determine the minimum number of tracks from two would-be singers they need to record in order to get the final song .\n\nInput format:\nThe first line of the set contains an integer n(2≤n≤50)—the length of the song. The second line of the set contains a string of n characters, each of which is 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' or 'G' (by artist name).\n\nOutput format:\nAs an answer, print the minimum number of tracks from two artists that Spock still needs to record.\n\nExamples\n\\nInput:\\n4\\nABAB\\nOutput:\\n2\\n\\nInput:\\n7\\nABACABA\\nOutput:\\n4\\n\\nInput:\\n6\\nAAAAAA\\ n\\nOutput:\\n1\\n\\nInput:\\n7\\nABCDEFG\\n\\nOutput:\\n6\\n\\nInput:\\n5\\nBABDD\\n\\nOutput:\\n4\\n\n\nNote:\nIn the first example, you need to record the tracks \"AB\" and \"BA\", as described in the condition.

There is a wall of size n×m ( n is the height of the wall, am is the width). The wall needs to be completely lined, that is, a certain number of panels must be placed inside so that they are positioned horizontally or vertically and do not protrude beyond the boundaries of the wall. It is also impossible to overlap panels on top of each other. Naturally, therefore, a wall can have panels with different k values. The horizontality of a wall is the number of panels located horizontally minus the number of panels located vertically. Please note that if you used 0 horizontal panels and 2 vertical panels, you will get horizontality is −2, not 2. The same can be said about verticality. But we’re not talking about that now.

Moreover, as it turned out, one number can change its sign two or more times. Accounting is a very complicated science. Mathematically, the operation of replacing the sign of a number is called the operation of multiplying this number by -1. Our task is to help education, namely, to make replacements so that the total amount of the change in funding (the sum of the numbers in the resulting sequence) was the maximum.

This is the consumer situation. In order for Klava to remain the best employee of the month, she must serve ALL clients. So, in the queue of people, Klava has exactly a jar of black caviar and a jar of squash. Will Klava remain at the stand of the best workers?\n\nInput format:\nThe original line contains three integers n,a,b (1≤n,a,b≤100) — the number of customers, cans of black and cans of squash caviar, respectively.\n\nOutput format:\nPrint \"YES\" if Klava serves all customers and becomes employee of the month. Otherwise print \"NO\".\n\nExamples\n\\nInput:\\n5 8 6\\nOutput:\\nYES\\n\\nInput:\\n3 9 3\\nOutput:\\nYES\\n\\nInput:\\n8 5 20\\nOutput:\\nNO\\n",

Launches? Both fireworks installations are launched simultaneously. My installation releases fireworks every minutes (that is, a, 2⋅a, 3⋅a, ... minutes after launch). The comrade's installation releases a fireworks every b minutes (that is, b, 2⋅b, 3⋅b, ... minutes after launch). Each salvo of fireworks is visible in the sky m + 1 minute after launch, that is, if a shell with a fireworks was fired x minutes after the launch of the installations, then it will be visible every minute from x to x + m inclusive. If one projectile with fireworks was fired m minutes after the other, then both fireworks will be visible within one minute. What is the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time?\n\nInput format:\nThe input data line contains natural numbers a,b,m (1≤a,b,m≤1018) — the frequency of launching the first installation, the second installation and the time that the fireworks are visible in the sky.\n\nOutput format:\nPrint a single number—the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen at the same time.\n\nExamples\n\\nInput:\\n6 7 4\\nOutput:\\n2\\n\\nInput:\\n3 4 10\\nOutput:\\n7\\n\\nInput:\\n7 8 56\\nOutput:\\n17\\n\\nInput:\\n5 6 78123459896\\nOutput:\\n28645268630\\n\\nInput:\\n1 1 1\\nOutput:\\n4\\n\\nInput:\\n1 1 1000000000000000000\\nOutput:\\n2000000000000000002\\n\n\nNote:\nIn the first test, fireworks are visible in the sky for 5 minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks once every 6 minutes, and the second - once every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from one installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same time, 7 minutes after the start of the holiday, one firework will be visible, launched from the first and second installations. Thus, no more than 2 fireworks can be seen at the same time. In the third test, after 112 minutes, 17 fireworks will be visible: 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at moments [56,63,70,77,84,91,98,105,112]; 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at moments [ 56,64,72,80,88,96,104,112].",

And this is the next task of this tournament. Can you solve it? I have white cubes. I folded them into a kind of parallelepiped. And painted it on the outside with red paint. That is, from above and from the side (I can’t do this from below, you understand). Now let’s disassemble my parallelepiped and remove all the cubes that are red on any face. Let's say that I have n completely white cubes left. And now the question: taking into account the fact that initially the parallelepiped could be anything, according to the known number n, find the minimum possible and maximum possible number of cubes that we can paint.\n\nInput format:\nThe only line contains the integer n from the problem conditions (1 ≤ n ≤ 109).\n\nOutput format:\nPrint, through a space, the minimum and maximum number of cubes that can be colored (that is, have red paint somewhere on their faces).\n\nExamples\n\\nInput:\\n4\\nOutput:\\n28 41\\n\\nInput:\\n7\\nOutput:\\n47 65\\n\\nInput:\\n12\\nOutput:\\n48 105\\n\n\nNote:\nLet's look at the first test from the example. There are 4 white cubes left. If initially the cubes were arranged into a parallelepiped of 32 = 2 × 4 × 4 cubes, then after painting there will be (2-1) × (4-2) × (4-2) = 4 white cubes (remove one top layer of cubes, and two on each side). In this case there will be 32-4=28 colored cubes. And this is the minimum case. If initially the cubes were arranged into a parallelepiped of 45 = 5 × 3 × 3 cubes, then after painting there will also be (5-1) × (3-2) × (3-2) = 4 white cubes. And the number of painted ones will be 45-4=41. And this is the maximum case. In no other variant of the initial placement of cubes into a parallelepiped can the number of colored cubes be less than 28 or more than 41. Let's not hide, this is one of the most difficult tasks of the tournament! Read carefully, understand this example and go for it!",

I propose to hold a New Year's competition in eating sweets at speed. Today is a team competition, so a team of k people is participating. There are bags of candy in a line on a long table, and before the start of the competition, each team member takes several bags in a row from the table, starting from the left. You can take any number of bags, including none if the previous team member took the last bag. The last team member takes all the remaining bags from the table. You cannot exchange bags, and several team members cannot eat candy from the same bag. After distributing the bags of candy, the signal to start is given, and all participants begin to eat candy. The completion time is determined by the participant who ate the last candy and is rounded up to the nearest whole number of seconds. The number of candies in the bags may vary, so it is important to distribute the bags among team members so that the time spent eating candies is minimal. It is known that a person can eat exactly candy per second (candy is small - jelly beans). Determine the minimum time required for a team to eat candy.\n\nInput format:\nThe first input line contains three integers – the number of bags of candy n(1≤n≤105), the number of team members k(1≤k≤105) and the speed of eating candy s(1≤s≤50).

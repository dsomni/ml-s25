The famous palindrome is a phrase from a fairy tale about Pinocchio: \"And Rosa fell on the paw of Azor.\" We assume that the empty line is also a palindrome. Garri introduced a new concept of a line - Harrid. The line is a Harridrom if you can find such a symbol in it, and then remove this symbol from the line in a completely random order so that the remaining line (after gluing the remaining parts) becomes a palindrome. For example: • “Pop” is a Harrindrome, because you can not delete a single symbol and the deadline will become a pallet (that is, the palindrome is automatically Harridrom). Harridrom, because you can take the symbol “U” and remove both symbols “U” in the line. The remaining line will become a palindrome. • “Super” is a Harridrome, because you can take the “U” symbol and remove or all the “U” symbols in the line or only the fourth “U” symbol. In both cases, the remaining lines will become palindromes. • “Sweat” is not a Harridrom, because not to find such a symbol, when the line is removed, the line will become a palindrome.

Each robot has a favorite number, and we thought that it would be great to make a separate tower for each robot, such that the number of visible points on the tower would correspond to the favorite number of this robot. But we were not sure that it would be possible to build the right tower. For example, the number of visible points on the tower painted below, equal 29 is the number of points on the upper side of the upper cube equal1. And on the four sides of the tower, the faces are visible on the following number of points: 5i3C south side, 4i2s of the western side, 2i4s of the north side, and 3i5s of the eastern side. The native line of the first cube (with a unit) and faces with six points are not visible in the number of visible points. The event was invited by robots, each of which is their favorite number. Then I was instructed to write a program so that for each of the numbers, it is possible to build a tower of cubes for which the number of visible points is equal to this number. In those days, I coped with this task, and the event was successful.

And you think why there is such an expression “a couple of trifles”. Yes, because all trifles have a couple (unlike, by the way, from socks). And recently one familiar wizard brought me a bag of trifles and asked to lay them in pairs into his magic hat. I asked and disappeared. Well, I asked - we’ll do it. It is known that in a bag N steam trifles, which are initially mixed there and lie in a mess. And in order not to get confused, the wizard numbered all the pairs of trifles from 11don. Yes, yes, trifles with numbers, estimate the picture. Well, then, we will lay them out in pairs. To do this, we will get trifles from the bag one at a time and, in the absence of a couple, we will put them carefully so that we do not scatter, on a carpet, which the wizard kindly left us. If at a certain moment of getting the next trifle from the bag a couple of trifles forms, then we do not put another trifle on the carpet, but take his pair from the carpet, put them together and put them in a magic hat. And God forbid us to get confused and draw non -labeled affairs, so we will be very attentive, and we will write down the numbers in which we got trifles from the bag. And here is a hurray! All trifles are sorted and moved in pairs into a magic hat. And what is the maximum number of trifles at the same time lying on the carpet? Why know this? And just like that.\n\nInput format:\nThe first line is the only number (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) - the number of pairs of trifles.

The wall needs to be completely lined, that is, it is possible to steal a certain number of panels inside, so that they are located horizontally or vertically and do not crawl out the boundaries of the wall. It is also impossible to apply the panels on each other. It is also possible, therefore, there may be panels with different values ​​of K. Gorisontality of the wall - this is the number of panels located horizontally, minus the number of panels located vertically.
